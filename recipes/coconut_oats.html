            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These creamy coconut overnight oats have a great flavor and a boost of protein from Greek yogurt and chia seeds. I topped them with cacao nibs and almonds, but feel free to use fresh fruit or any other topping. Add honey or maple syrup if you like them sweeter.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup old-fashioned oats</li>
