        <h2>Look at These Fried Delights</h2>
        <p>I didn't think I liked apple fritters, but turns out I just don't like chunks of almost raw apple, surrounded by a doughnut. Maybe I've just been going to the wrong shops, but I've never enjoyed the texture, and always wanted to try them with cooked apples.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients for Dough</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>2 large Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sparkling apple cider</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients for glaze</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sparkling apple cider, or as needed to make glaze</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps to Make</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter over medium-high heat and cook until it turns golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add apples and cook over medium-high heat until apples just begin to soften around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle in 1 tablespoon sugar and continue cooking another 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Drain in a strainer; let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg together in a mixing bowl until well combined.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg, 1/4 cup sugar, and melted butter together in a separate mixing bowl. Add cooled apple pieces and sparkling apple cider; add the flour mixture. Stir just until flour is incorporated.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spoon about 2 tablespoons batter per fritter, into hot oil, slightly flattening them out. Cook in batches. Fry on one side until small bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip fritters over and fry the other side until richly browned, about 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain grease. Cool slightly before glazing.</li>
            <li>Whisk powdered sugar and cinnamon in a mixing bowl. Add enough apple cider, 1 teaspoon at a time, to form a smooth glaze that is just runny enough to drizzle over fritters.</li>
        </ol>
